# Notes from Kaitlyn
Thank you for taking the time to review my benchmark test. This was my first time using angular, and I enjoyed setting up this project a lot.
I built the product directory from a back-of-house/company perspective, rather than customer-facing. 

If I had more time in future, next steps would include:
- Adding pagination to the product directory.
- With more information and scope for the project, having category directories which could be linked to from the category on each product component.

# Instructions

This is a quick test to establish a benchmark af your angular knowladge and skills. There is no time limmit but please make use of your own coding and style (no copy and paste)

Be creative with the test (make it look nice) as this helps us to establush creativity and initiative.

There are 3 tasks in total. The first can be found on app.component.ts

Once completed please commit your changes to the repository for assessment. Please remember that you will have to create a fork and once completed (changes committed) you will need to do a pull request

Asking questions WILL NOT count against you in any way


REMEMBER: Enjoy it. Coding is fun!

## BenchmarkTest

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.7.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
